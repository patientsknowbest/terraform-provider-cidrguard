# cidrguard_registry (Data Source)

Provides a way to manage and validate a registry of CIDR blocks, ensuring they do not overlap.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "cidrguard_registry" "main" {
  networks = [
    {
      name        = "vpc-main"
      cidr        = "10.0.0.0/16"
      description = "Main VPC"
    },
    {
      name        = "vpc-secondary"
      cidr        = "10.1.0.0/16"
      description = "Secondary VPC"
    },
  ]
}

output "all_networks" {
  description = "The full map of all network details, keyed by network name."
  value       = data.cidrguard_registry.main.network
}

output "main_vpc_first_ip" {
  description = "The first IP of the main VPC, accessed directly by its name."
  value       = data.cidrguard_registry.main.network["vpc-main"].first_ip
}
```
